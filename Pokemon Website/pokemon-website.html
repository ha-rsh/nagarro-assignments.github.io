        <p>Pokémon(an abbreviation for Pocket Monsters[b] in Japan) is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, a company founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1996,[4] and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon". In Pokémon, humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. All media works within the franchise are set in the Pokémon universe. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch ‘Em All!".There are currently 913 Pokémon species.
            The franchise began as Pocket Monsters: Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red and Blue), a pair of video games for the original Game Boy handheld system that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996. It soon became a media mix franchise adapted into various different media.[8] Pokémon is estimated to be the highest-grossing media franchise of all time. The Pokémon video game series is the fourth best-selling video game franchise of all time with more than 440 million copies sold[9] and one billion mobile downloads.

        <h2>ASH Kechum</h2>
        <p>Ash wears a new outfit that slightly resembles his original outfit. He wears a blue vest with yellow outlines, while his undershirt resembles the sleeping clothes that he wore in Kalos. He remains with no gloves as he did in Alola. He wears indigo shorts with black outlines coming from each side of his shorts similar to his Ultra Guardian uniform and wears black sneakers with blue highlights and a white "X" on front respectively. His hat resembles the one he wore in Hoenn, and the Poké Ball design is in a black shape of the letter C.

        <h2>Garry oak</h2>
        <p>Gary Oak is a tall, thin young man with light skin, brown eyes, and tall, brown spiky hair. The day Gary started out on his Pokémon journey, he came off as an arrogant and egotistical Trainer. His chosen starter Pokémon was Squirtle, which was actually the same Pokémon that Ash originally wanted to start with, and he even had a group of cheerleaders who cheered him on in all of his battles, and they would go so far as crying whenever he lost. He didn't walk on his journeys like most Trainers did; instead he had his own sporty red convertible with a chauffeur.

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">BATTLE</h2>
        <p>A Pokémon battle often known as a Pokémon fight in the Generation I games, is a form of competition between Pokémon. In these battles, one or more of the Pokémon is typically owned and trained by a person, its Pokémon Trainer, in order to win.
            When a Pokémon faints in battle, its Trainer may send out another to take its place, drawn from their party.
            Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the central gameplay aspect of the core series games, as well as being a constant focus of the anime. Originally, a Pokémon battle would be a one-on-one fight between two Pokémon; however, variations on this model have been seen later on in the series, with Pokémon battles featuring multiple Pokémon on each side later being implemented in the games as well.
            In the games, the main battle screen will have four options: Fight, Bag, Pokémon, and Run. Depending on which of these is selected, a different menu will appear, or the battle may end. These same four options will appear no matter what kind of battle the player is in, be it with a wild Pokémon, an NPC, or another player via link battle. Battles are conducted in a turn-based manner. The Pokémon to take action first is determined by the priority of their action, then the Speed of the Pokémon.
