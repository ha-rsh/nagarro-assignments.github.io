            <h2>Greninja</h2>
            <p>Greninja, like its previous evolution, has the body style of a frog. In this form, it now resembles Toxicroak and has gained the appearance of a ninja. It is dark blue in color and has its tongue wrapped around its neck like a scarf instead of the bubbles found on Froakie and Frogadier. </p>

            <h2>Septile</h2>
            <p>Sceptile is a large, bipedal, reptilian, gecko-like Pokémon that also possess the traits of dinosaurs. It has powerfully-built limbs and muscular legs that allow it to run at high speeds to chase after its prey in the jungles where it lives. Its body is mostly vivid green in color, and it has a gracefully rounded belly with a horizontal, pale red stripe extending across it. </p>

            <h2>Charizard</h2>
            <p>Charizard is a large, dragon-like Pokémon that differs greatly from its pre-evolved form. The red skin coloration of Charmeleon is no longer apparent, as Charizard appears to have reverted to the orange/yellow coloration of Charmander. Two large fangs can be seen when its mouth is closed.</p>

            <h2>Infernape</h2>
            <p>Infernape is based upon the ape as cleared from its name. Its body color is brown and it has flame over its head. A brown tail is also present. Its fist resembles the man's fist having power to use fighting type moves. It has several gold plates that cover its body on its shoulders, wrists, knees, and chest. Infernape's arms, legs, and head are white. </p>

            <h2>Pikachu</h2>
            <p>Pikachu are small, chubby, and cute mouse-like Pokémon. They are almost completely covered by yellow fur. They have long yellow ears that are tipped with black. A Pikachu's back has two brown stripes, and its large tail is notable for being shaped like a lightning bolt, yet its brown tip is almost always forgotten. </p>
